# The Picnic Cafe 

## HTML EMAIL
Created and designed Valentine's Day promotional email project for local cafe in Nashville, TN.

## Main objective 
Create a clean and coherent design that embodies what the business stands for including color scheme, typeface, and general structure with adding a Valentine's Day theme. The Picnic Cafe has stunning charm with its "picnic-style" embellishments and is a cherished Nashville go-to for many. There are no "bells and whistles" in terms of how they market or promote the cafe. I didn't want to take away from their core values of being traditional. 

## Workflow / Process 
Research, competitive analysis, design, code, modify, test, and deploy. 

## Skills and Tools Used 

#### Responsive layout 
Using HTML and internal/inline CSS languages with dark mode enabled feature.

#### Photoshop and Illustrator 
To create and enhance graphics including images, logos, and color coordination between elements in the project and existing business website and social media.

#### Email testing, structure, and layout
With Litmus platform and Visual Studio Code. 

## Obstacles 
Designing a Valentine's Day theme that wasn't about "love" or implementing a tradiitonal red color scheme. Luckily, I found the perfect image on their Facebook site of one of the cookies they bake for that occasion, which I used as the hero image. From that image, I created content, color scheme, and overall theme for the project. 

## What I gained 
Developed skills within a different platform and structure in terms of coding and design. Creating a cohesive layout and design that embodies the business/client.
